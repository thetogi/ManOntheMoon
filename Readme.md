# Man on the Moon Review Service ![Moon Man](moon_man.jpg)

Hello, welcome to the Man on the Moon Game Review Service by Derek Askham!

This service has several RESTful API endpoints that allow:

- Players of the online game "Man on the Moon" to submit feedback for their last game session.
- Members of an operations team to view and filter the feedback.
- Users can give their session a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, and can leave a comment.
- Multiple players can rate the same session, but each player can only rate a given session once.

# Instructions to set up service

## Requirements
- Goland or similar IDE
- MySQL Server 8.0 with user credentials that has at a minimum read and write access.
- MySQL Service running on `localhost:3306`
- ManOnTheMoon schema and tables script
- Docker

## Deployment Files
  `{project-root}/DockerFile`

  `{project-root}/Docker-Compose.yaml `


## Test Files

  `{project-root}/controllers/controllers_test.go`

  *Description*: Runs tests on each API endpoint

## Testing

  Docker: Use CLI and run docker the below docker Command

    docker-compose run man-on-the-moon go test -v ./...

## System Design

## Install & Deploy
  1. Clone or download project to local machine

  `git clone <path-to-repo>`

  2. If you haven't already, install MySQL Server 8.0 on your host machine. Using a user with create permissions, run the provided script `ManOnTheMoonPopulate.sql` to build the database structures and populate sample data. The script is found in the root directory of the go project.

  3. Update the USER and PASSWORD environment variables in `dbConfig.env.dev` in the root directory of the go project with a user from you instance of MySQL with read and write permissions. You will not be able to connect to MySQL if this step isn't done.

  4. Build the go project from the project root.

    `go build .`

  5. Using the CLI go to the project root use the below Docker command to build and deploy the service on port `:8080`.

    `docker-compose up`

  6. Use a browser, such as Chrome, or your preferred RESTful endpoint testing tools for testing the defined endpoints referenced below. The below API documentation provides examples using CURL.

  7. To test if service is running you can use your browser or CURL against the below endpoint.

    `http://localhost:8080/Health-Check`


# Assumptions
- Users can only submit feedback on a completed game session. If the game connection was interrupted, no prompt for feedback would occur.
- Ratings are used by operations to monitor and report app health on a regular basis, but perhaps not used as the sole source of app health in real time.

## Known Issues/Bugs

- When running tests there is a bug with the godotenv library finding the environment file. The current setup is to use docker to inject environment variables from the `dbConfig.env.dev` file. If running tests or executing the build outside of docker db/db.go will need to be changed to use the commented out `connectionString()` function to use the `.env` instead.
  - To fix this I would want to continue research and trying different suggestions from the issued documented in the link below. I may want to rethink approach to how I'm setting up environment variables for my environments
